Paracooba
=========

This is a tool for distributed parallel SAT solving. It automatically manages the solving
process of formulas with provided cubes over a network of compute nodes. It also has
a basic integrated cubing algorithm. Cubes can be provided to this tool in "iCNF" format
(normal DIMACS with appended cubes of the form `a 1 2 3 0`). These cubes can for example be
generated by [March](https://github.com/marijnheule/CnC).

Usage
-----

The two usage scenarios are described below. Additional command line arguments are
provided, use `--help` for more information.

### Master-Node ("solve this formula for me")

    parac <file.[i]cnf> [--enable-internal-webserver]

### Daemon-Node ("provide compute node for other masters in the network")

    parac --daemon
